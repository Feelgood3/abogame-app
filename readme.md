# Aboga.me

Aboga.me is born due to my experiences as a Lawyer, being able to realice the harsh juridictional reality of Colombia. In this country, a major part of the population does not have access to a Lawyer nor basic law knowledge, and does not know how to ask for legal counsel either.

Aboga.me wants to be a step forward in guaranteeing the right of access to the justice system, and has the following functionality.

This application is built in React Native, and is working on Android 12 and iOS 15.6 

Many thanks to the Make It Real Bootcamp for their support during these long months.
